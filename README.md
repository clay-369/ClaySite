# ClaySite

Welcome to my personal portfolio website made with Nuxt! This website serves as a digital introduction to who I am. You can also find some of my projects I have contributed to or developed independently.

Feel free to take a look at my code and give me feedback on this project if you have any. This project is open source so feel free to use the code i used in your own projects. Enjoy!

This site is hosted on vercel: https://clay-site-clay-369s-projects.vercel.app/#/
